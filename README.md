# Graph Dungeon Generator

A simple graph-based procedural dungeon generator.

Want to play with the generator? [Try the demo here](https://halftheopposite.github.io/graph-dungeon-generator/) and have some fun 🧙‍♂️.

## Running the project 🚀

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` to build and run the project and listen for changes.
4. Finally, double-click the `public/index.html` file to open the generator in your browser.

## Examples

Given the same input graph, we can generate many dungeon shapes and pattern.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="assets/dungeon-1.png" width="300px"></td>
        <td><img src="assets/dungeon-2.png" width="300px"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="assets/dungeon-3.png" width="300px"></td>
        <td><img src="assets/dungeon-4.png" width="300px"></td>
    </tr> 
</table>

## Architecture 

The project is split into 3 distinct modules (aka folders) in an effort to separate concerns:

- `/generate`: where all the generation code lies (returns an `Node<Room>` tree).
- `/draw`: where we take the `Node<Room>` tree, generate a tilesmap, and render it to an HTML canvas with some debugging information.
- `/graphs`: the list of input files used to generate the dungeon. Currently written in TypeScript for type safety, but could as well be JSON files.

## What can it do? 👍

- Generate a dungeon given a non-circular graph
- Backtracking when it cannot find a suitable spot for a child node
- Elegantly place the corridors between rooms
- Transform a node tree into a tilesmap
- Render contextual information for convenience
- Easily modifiable to add new room types and colors

## What can't it do? 👎

This generator does not handle overly complex situations such as:

- Nodes with too many children
- L-shaped corridors
- Circular nodes (ex: A → B → C → A)

## Roadmap 🗺️

- [x] Prevent rooms from touching sides which doesn't respect graph constraints
- [ ] Pick from a set of predefined rooms that are rectangles
